## Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
### Generative AI, also known as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or other generative models, is a subset of artificial intelligence that aims to generate new content that is similar to existing data. It involves two main components: a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates synthetic data, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and generated data.
