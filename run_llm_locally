Running large language models (LLMs) locally is becoming more feasible thanks to open-source models and advances in hardware and software optimization. Here's a quick guide on how to do it, from choosing a model to running it locally:
‚úÖ 1. Choose an Appropriate LLM

Depending on your hardware and use case, here are common options:
Model Name	Size	Good for
LLaMA 2 / 3	7B ‚Äì 70B	General-purpose, high-quality
Mistral	7B	Small and fast, competitive
Mixtral (MoE)	12.9B (2-of-8)	High performance, optimized size
Phi-2	2.7B	Educational, lightweight
Gemma (Google)	2B ‚Äì 7B	Efficient, relatively lightweight
üíª 2. Prepare Your Environment

Hardware requirements:

    Minimum for small models: 8‚Äì16 GB RAM (CPU) or 6‚Äì8 GB VRAM (GPU)

    For 7B+ models: Ideally a GPU with ‚â•16 GB VRAM (e.g., RTX 3090, A100)

    CPU-only inference is possible with optimizations (e.g., GGUF)

Operating System: Linux, macOS, or Windows
üß∞ 3. Tools to Run LLMs Locally
‚û§ LM Studio (GUI, Easy to Use)

    Cross-platform desktop app

    Run quantized GGUF models with llama.cpp backend

    No coding needed

‚û§ llama.cpp

    C++ backend for running LLMs (CPU/GPU)

    Supports GGUF quantized models (low RAM/VRAM)

    Can run in command line or with a web UI

‚û§ Ollama

    Simplified CLI tool to pull and run models

    Supports multiple models (Mistral, LLaMA, Gemma, etc.)

    Easy to use with GPU/CPU support

‚û§ Text Generation WebUI

    Full-featured web UI with fine-tuning, multi-model support

    Heavier, best for advanced users

üîÑ 4. Get the Model Files

Models are often available in GGUF or Safetensors formats:

    Use sites like Hugging Face or TheBloke‚Äôs models

    Download the model matching your tool (e.g., GGUF for llama.cpp)

‚ñ∂Ô∏è 5. Run the Model

For example, using llama.cpp:

git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp
cd llama.cpp
make

# Run with a quantized GGUF model
./main -m ./models/your-model.gguf -p "What is the capital of France?"

Or with Ollama:

ollama run mistral

üß† Tips

    Quantized models (Q4, Q5, Q8) trade off precision for performance. Q4 is fastest, Q8 is most accurate.

    Use batching and GPU acceleration if available for better performance.
