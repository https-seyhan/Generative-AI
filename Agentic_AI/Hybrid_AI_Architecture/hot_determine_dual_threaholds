correct architecture:

LLM = semantic investigator (signal generator)
ML (LightGBM) = calibrated decision engine (risk ranking)

Now the operational problem you’re solving is decision theory, not modeling.

You are not asking:

“Is this fraud?”

You are asking:

“When should I trust the model enough to act automatically, and when should a human intervene?”

That is a selective classification problem (also called classification with rejection).
The solution is a dual-threshold policy.

1) What Dual Thresholds Actually Mean

Your LightGBM does not output a class.

It outputs a probability:

p=P(fraud∣features)
p=P(fraud∣features)

(Features = structured signals extracted by the LLM + behavioural ML features)

So every case receives a risk score between 0 and 1.

Example:

Case	Risk Score
A	0.04
B	0.22
C	0.48
D	0.71
E	0.93

If you force a single threshold (ex: 0.5):

• >0.5 → escalate
• <0.5 → decline

This is exactly what produces False Positives.

Because fraud detection datasets have a property:

The model is very certain at the extremes

and very unreliable in the middle.

This is called probability uncertainty concentration.

The middle zone is where most FPs live.

2) The Three-Zone Risk Policy (The Real System)

Instead of 1 threshold → use 2 thresholds

TL<TH
T
L
	​

<T
H
	​


You divide the probability line into 3 decision regions:

0 ------------------ TL ----------- TH ------------------ 1

Decline             Human Review       Escalate
(auto safe)         (uncertain)        (auto block)


So:

Score	Action
p ≤ TL	Decline (auto clear)
TL < p < TH	Unclear → Human review
p ≥ TH	Escalate (auto intervene)

This is the only known practical way to significantly reduce FP without increasing FN catastrophically.

3) Why This Reduces False Positives

False positives occur when:

a normal case gets a moderately high risk score

Those almost never occur at 0.95.

They occur around:

0.35 – 0.70


This region is called:

The ambiguity band

The model sees some suspicious signals, but not enough.

Typical example in your hybrid system:

LLM detects:

related directors

rapid transactions

similar addresses

But ML behavioural features weak:

long operating history

stable payments

tax compliance

Model becomes confused → produces ~0.55

If you had a single threshold = 0.5 → False Positive

With dual threshold → human review instead

You just removed a large portion of FP automatically.

4) How To Find the Thresholds (This is the key part)

You DO NOT pick thresholds arbitrarily.

You derive them from calibrated probabilities + cost analysis.

You need a validation dataset with known labels.

For each possible threshold, compute:

TPR (recall)

FPR (false positive rate)

Precision

Step 1 — Calibrate the model first (VERY important)

LightGBM probabilities are not true probabilities.

You must calibrate:

Use:

Isotonic Regression (best)
or

Platt Scaling

Python:

from sklearn.calibration import CalibratedClassifierCV

calibrated_model = CalibratedClassifierCV(lgbm, method='isotonic', cv=5)
calibrated_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

probs = calibrated_model.predict_proba(X_valid)[:,1]


Without this step → dual thresholds will fail.

Because 0.8 may actually mean 0.3.

Step 2 — Plot Risk vs Error

You compute FPR at every threshold.

import numpy as np

thresholds = np.linspace(0,1,200)

for t in thresholds:
    pred = probs >= t
    fp = ((pred==1) & (y_valid==0)).sum()
    tn = ((pred==0) & (y_valid==0)).sum()
    fpr = fp/(fp+tn)
    print(t, fpr)


You will see:

FPR collapses sharply after a certain point.

Typically:

Threshold	FPR
0.50	18%
0.65	9%
0.75	3%
0.85	0.7%
0.90	0.2%

This is the mathematical place to put TH.

Step 3 — Choose TH (Escalation threshold)

Define a business tolerance:

Example:

“We accept only 1% false accusations.”

Then choose:

TH = \text{lowest threshold where FPR ≤ 1%}

That becomes your auto-escalate boundary.

Step 4 — Choose TL (Auto-decline threshold)

Now look at the other side.

We want:

very low probability of fraud among cleared cases.

Compute:

P(fraud∣p≤t)
P(fraud∣p≤t)

Pick the highest t where this risk is tiny (e.g. 0.2%).

That becomes TL.

Typically you’ll see:

Threshold	Fraud Rate Below Threshold
0.10	0.02%
0.15	0.05%
0.20	0.12%
0.25	0.40%

So TL ≈ 0.18

5) What the System Now Does

Example final policy:

TL = 0.18
TH = 0.82

Risk Score	Decision
0.04	Decline
0.22	Human
0.48	Human
0.71	Human
0.88	Escalate
0.97	Escalate

Now:

• FPs drop dramatically
• Humans only review ambiguous cases
• Automation still high

This is exactly how banking AML transaction monitoring systems work.

6) The Hidden Insight (Most Important)

Your hybrid LLM + ML system does not classify fraud.

It does:

risk triage

The LLM creates semantic suspicion signals
The ML model ranks them by similarity to known fraud patterns
The thresholds determine operational trust

The human reviewer is not a fallback.

They are part of the classifier.

Mathematically:

System Accuracy=Auto Decisions+Human Decisions in Uncertainty Region
System Accuracy=Auto Decisions+Human Decisions in Uncertainty Region

The unclear band is not a weakness.

It is what allows you to reduce false positives without killing recall.

7) Production Decision Policy (pseudocode)
p = calibrated_model.predict_proba(case)[1]

if p >= TH:
    decision = "ESCALATE"
elif p <= TL:
    decision = "DECLINE"
else:
    decision = "UNCLEAR → HUMAN REVIEW"


That’s the complete deployment logic.
