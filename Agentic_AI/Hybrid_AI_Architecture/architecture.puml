upstream --> intake : create case
intake --> store : persist evidence
store --> llm : retrieve context
llm --> feats : structured signals (JSON)
feats --> ml : feature vector
ml --> policy : probability p
policy --> actions : p ≤ TL or p ≥ TH
policy --> queue : TL < p < TH
human --> queue : review/attest
queue --> actions : final decision

ml --> monitor : score distribution
queue --> monitor : workload metrics
monitor --> policy : update TL, TH
