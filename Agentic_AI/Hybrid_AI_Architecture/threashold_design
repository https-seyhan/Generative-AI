Now we get to the part that actually makes or breaks an AML system.

You do not “pick” thresholds.
You derive them from expected loss + analyst capacity + regulatory tolerance.

The thresholds are the control mechanism that converts a probability model into an operational surveillance program.

We will do this properly (the way large banks and model-risk committees approve).

Step 0 — What you already have

Your classifier outputs a calibrated probability:

p=P(financial crime)
p=P(financial crime)

For every customer or case you now have:

0.01
0.07
0.18
0.34
0.52
0.81


Your job is to convert p → action

Action	Class
decline	ignore
unclear	analyst review
escalate	SAR/STR candidate

You need two thresholds:

Treview,  Tescalate
T
review
	​

,T
escalate
	​

Step 1 — Define the real costs (this is the missing piece in most projects)

AML is not a prediction problem.
It is a risk economics problem.

You must assign operational costs.

Example realistic cost model:

Event	Meaning	Approx cost
Analyst review	manual investigation	$40–$120
False escalation	unnecessary SAR	$300–$1500
Missed laundering	regulatory + reputational	$50,000–$5M

(Exact values don’t matter — ratios matter.)

We define:

C_review
C_false_escalate
C_missed_crime

Step 2 — Expected loss for each decision

For a case with probability p:

If you DECLINE

You risk missing crime.

Lossdecline=p×Cmissed_crime
Loss
decline
	​

=p×C
missed_crime
	​

If you REVIEW

You always pay analyst cost.

Lossreview=Creview
Loss
review
	​

=C
review
	​

If you ESCALATE

If innocent → wasted SAR.

Lossescalate=(1−p)×Cfalse_escalate
Loss
escalate
	​

=(1−p)×C
false_escalate
	​

Step 3 — Derive the thresholds mathematically

You choose the action with lowest expected loss.

Review threshold 
Treview
T
review
	​


Review becomes better than Decline when:

Creview<p⋅Cmissed_crime
C
review
	​

<p⋅C
missed_crime
	​

p>CreviewCmissed_crime
p>
C
missed_crime
	​

C
review
	​

	​


So:

Treview=CreviewCmissed_crime
T
review
	​

=
C
missed_crime
	​

C
review
	​

	​

Escalation threshold 
Tescalate
T
escalate
	​


Escalate becomes better than Review when:

(1−p)⋅Cfalse_escalate<Creview
(1−p)⋅C
false_escalate
	​

<C
review
	​

p>1−CreviewCfalse_escalate
p>1−
C
false_escalate
	​

C
review
	​

	​


So:

Tescalate=1−CreviewCfalse_escalate
T
escalate
	​

=1−
C
false_escalate
	​

C
review
	​

	​

Step 4 — Example numbers

Assume:

C_review = 80
C_false_escalate = 800
C_missed_crime = 80,000

Review threshold
Treview=80/80,000=0.001
T
review
	​

=80/80,000=0.001

(very low — meaning even tiny risk deserves a look in theory)

But operational capacity will override this (next step).

Escalate threshold
Tescalate=1−80/800=0.90
T
escalate
	​

=1−80/800=0.90

Meaning:
Only very strong evidence justifies SAR filing.

This is why escalation thresholds are always high.

Step 5 — Capacity constraint (the real-world adjustment)

Mathematics alone floods analysts.

So we apply queue control.

Procedure:

Score 6–12 months historical customers

Sort by probability (highest → lowest)

Simulate thresholds

Find probability where:

review alerts per day ≈ analyst team capacity


Example:

Threshold	Alerts/day
0.20	3200
0.30	1100
0.40	620
0.45	480

If analysts can handle 500/day:

Treview≈0.45
T
review
	​

≈0.45

Now you have an operationally feasible system.

Step 6 — Validate with PR curve (critical)

You now verify:

At chosen thresholds measure:

Metric	Why
Precision	SAR quality
Recall	crimes detected
False positive rate	workload

If precision collapses → escalation threshold too low
If recall collapses → escalation threshold too high

Step 7 — Final policy

You will end with something like:

p < 0.45          → Decline
0.45 ≤ p < 0.82   → Human review
p ≥ 0.82          → Escalate


These numbers are derived, not guessed.

Why regulators like this

Because you can defend:

thresholds based on economic reasoning

aligned with investigative capacity

consistent treatment of customers

documented model governance

You are no longer saying:

“We chose 0.5 because that’s standard.”

You are saying:

“We selected thresholds via expected-loss minimisation and operational capacity simulation.”

That is exactly the language model risk and compliance committees expect.
