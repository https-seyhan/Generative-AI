This is the core engineering problem of the whole architecture.

How does the “LLM investigator” turn messy case information into numeric behavioural signals that an ML model can consume?

**This step is not classification and not prompting for a label.**

It is a **cognitive feature extractor**:

        <b>unstructured narrative + events</b>

        - behavioural analysis
        
        - structured schema
        
        - numeric features
