This is the core engineering problem of the whole architecture.

How does the “LLM investigator” turn messy case information into numeric behavioural signals that an ML model can consume?

This step is not classification and not prompting for a label.

It is a controlled conversion:

**unstructured narrative + events**

        behavioural analysis
        
        structured schema
        
        numeric features
