How does the “LLM investigator” turn messy case information into numeric behavioural signals that an ML model can consume?

**This step is not classification and not prompting for a label.**

It is a **cognitive feature extractor**:

**unstructured narrative + events**

        behavioural analysis
        
        structured schema
        
        numeric features
