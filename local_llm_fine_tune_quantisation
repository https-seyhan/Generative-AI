🎯 1. Fine-tuning – Teach the model something new
🔍 What it is:

Fine-tuning means continuing to train a pretrained model on task-specific or domain-specific data (e.g., medical, legal, company docs, customer support chat).
✅ Why you’d fine-tune:

    Improve performance on your own data (accuracy, tone, style)

    Add domain knowledge (e.g., summarizing scientific articles better)

    Customize how the model behaves or responds

    Teach the model new tasks (e.g., summarize in your own format)

🛠️ Tools for local fine-tuning:

    LoRA: efficient fine-tuning using small adapters

    QLoRA: LoRA + quantized models

    Frameworks: Hugging Face Transformers + PEFT, Axolotl, LLaMA Factory

🧊 2. Quantization – Shrink and speed up the model
🔍 What it is:

Quantization reduces the precision of the model’s weights (e.g., from 16-bit to 4-bit or 8-bit), making it smaller and faster—with minimal accuracy loss.
Precision	Size	Speed	Quality
FP32	Large	Slow	Highest
FP16	Smaller	Faster	Nearly as good
INT8/4-bit (quantized)	Much smaller	Much faster	Good enough for most use cases
✅ Why you’d quantize:

    Run large models on consumer hardware (8–16GB RAM)

    Reduce memory footprint significantly

    Improve inference speed (especially on CPU)

    Use the model on edge devices

🛠️ Tools for quantization:

    llama.cpp: uses GGUF models with quantized weights (4-bit, 5-bit, etc.)

    AutoGPTQ: fast GPU-based quantized inference

    bitsandbytes: for training/inference with 8-bit weights

    Quantized models: download from HuggingFace (look for Q4_K_M, Q5_0, etc.)

🧠 TL;DR
Process	Purpose	Use When...
Fine-tuning	Teach the model new behavior or knowledge	The model doesn’t do your task well yet
Quantization	Make the model smaller/faster for local use	You want to run it on limited hardware
