✅ Summary: What You Can Use Without Labels
Metric	SVD	LDA	NMF	Use When…
Coherence (c_v)	✔️	✔️	✔️	Best measure of topic quality
Diversity Score	✔️	✔️	✔️	Check uniqueness of topics
Perplexity	❌	✔️	❌	Good for generalization (LDA only)
pyLDAvis	❌	✔️	✔️	Great for inspecting topics manually

want to focus on unsupervised metrics that evaluate coherence, interpretability, and distinctiveness of topics.

Here’s how you can evaluate SVD, LDA, and NMF topic labeling quality without labels:
