Agentic AI refers to autonomous artificial intelligence systems designed to make decisions and take actions independently to achieve goals, without constant human intervention. 
These systems use tools, data, and large language models (LLMs) for multi-step reasoning, planning, learning from outcomes, and adapting to new situations to achieve complex tasks. 
Key characteristics include autonomy, proactivity, and the ability to learn, making them proactive "agents" rather than just reactive assistants. 

# How Agentic AI Works

    Goal Orientation:
    Agentic AI systems are given a goal or objective. 

Perception & Reasoning:
They perceive their environment, process information, and use LLMs for multi-step reasoning and planning to decide on the best course of action. 
Action & Tool Use:
These AI agents can access and use various tools, data sources, and even other AI systems to execute tasks. 
Adaptation & Learning:
Agentic AI adapts to changes in the environment and learns from the outcomes of its actions to improve future performance. 
Collaboration:
They can work cooperatively with humans and other AI systems to achieve broader objectives. 

Key Differences from Traditional AI

    Autonomy:
    Agentic AI acts proactively to pursue goals, whereas traditional AI is often reactive or requires detailed instructions. 

Planning & Reasoning:
Agentic AI performs multi-step reasoning and planning to achieve goals, going beyond simple function calls or content generation. 
Learning & Adaptation:
It learns from experience and adapts to dynamic environments, continuously improving its performance.
