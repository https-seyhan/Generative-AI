Ah, yes — on Databricks you can run into **permission/binding issues** because the containerized driver process sometimes restricts services from binding to `127.0.0.1:11434` or makes the port inaccessible to your notebook process.

Here’s how you can fix it:

---

## 🔑 Root Causes

1. **Port binding inside container**

   * If Ollama starts inside the container, but the notebook process is also in the container sandbox, sometimes `127.0.0.1` is not the right loopback.
   * Fix: bind to **all interfaces** (`0.0.0.0`) so it’s visible to processes.

2. **Port access restrictions**

   * Databricks containers may block non-root processes from binding to low or “protected” ports.
   * Fix: choose a higher unprivileged port (e.g. `10134`).

3. **Driver vs notebook isolation**

   * Even though your notebook is “on the driver”, in container services mode it runs in a slightly different namespace. If you bind Ollama strictly to `127.0.0.1`, your Python client may not see it.

## 🛠 Fix Ollama Bind Address + Port

### Step 1: Start Ollama on a safe port

In your **Dockerfile** or **init script**, run:

```bash
OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0 OLLAMA_PORT=10134 ollama serve
```

This binds Ollama to all interfaces, port `10134`.

---

### Step 2: Point your Python client to the new host/port

```python
import ollama, os

# Tell client where Ollama lives
os.environ["OLLAMA_HOST"] = "http://127.0.0.1:10134"

resp = ollama.chat(
    model="llama3.1:8b",
    messages=[{"role":"user","content":"Say hello"}]
)
print(resp["message"]["content"])
```

👉 If that still doesn’t work, try replacing `127.0.0.1` with the driver’s private hostname (Databricks sets `$DB_IS_DRIVER=true` on the driver, and the hostname is in `$DB_HOST` or you can get it via `socket.gethostname()`).

---

## 🔐 Keep it Private

* **Do not** expose `0.0.0.0` with an open security group to the internet — only Databricks driver + attached notebook processes should see it.
* If you want workers to talk to Ollama (less private), you’d need to expose the driver IP inside your VPC, but since you want **driver-only** inference, keeping `0.0.0.0` binding is fine — it’s still confined to the driver VM.

---

## ✅ Minimal Fix in Notebook

Try this sequence once:

```python
import subprocess, time, urllib.request, json

# Kill any old server
subprocess.run("pkill -f 'ollama serve'", shell=True)

# Start Ollama on a safe port
subprocess.Popen(
    "OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0 OLLAMA_PORT=10134 ollama serve > /databricks/driver/ollama.log 2>&1 &",
    shell=True
)

time.sleep(3)

# Verify
with urllib.request.urlopen("http://127.0.0.1:10134/api/version") as r:
    print("Ollama up:", json.loads(r.read()))
```

---

👉 Question: do you want me to give you a **ready-made init script** that enforces `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0` + `OLLAMA_PORT=10134` so every time your cluster boots, Ollama is already running on the correct port?
